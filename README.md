### Extension Method
<p>Did you know that in #CSharp and #ASPNET, you can extend the functionality of existing classes using #ExtensionMethods? These static methods allow you to add new methods to an existing class without modifying its source code or creating a new subclass. They're defined in a static class and marked with the 'this' keyword, and can be called on instances of the extended type as if they were instance methods. This makes #ExtensionMethods a powerful tool for adding custom functionality to existing code. Have you ever used extension methods in your own projects?
